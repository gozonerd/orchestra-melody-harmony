# Canonical Session-Start Instruction (auto-prepended by wire-consumer-repo.sh)

## Session-Start Discipline (READ FIRST)

This repo consumes the Martinez Methods SSOT via two git submodules under
`.claude/canonical/`. Before reading any other file in this repo, including the
rest of this CLAUDE.md, the SessionStart hook should have run:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --recursive .claude/canonical/
```

If that hook did NOT run (e.g., older settings.json, hook disabled), run it
manually before reading skills. Stale canonical content is a load-bearing
failure mode.

### Skill resolution order

1. **Repo-local override** — `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
2. **Canonical (general)** — `.claude/canonical/mm-claude-canonical/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
3. **Canonical (D2R)** — `.claude/canonical/mm-d2r-code-plan-stack/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

### Memory partition

Loaded from `.claude/canonical/mm-claude-canonical/memory/<detected-user>/`
where `<detected-user>` ∈ {krystal, cody, shared}. See
`.claude/canonical/mm-claude-canonical/skills/load-memory/SKILL.md` for the
detection algorithm.

**Fail-closed:** if user-detection cannot resolve to a definitive user AND the
session is non-interactive (no opportunity to ask), NO memory loads. Surface
warning at session top; continue session without memory. Cross-user
contamination is a load-bearing failure mode (handoff §2.2 + design doc §11.8).

### Failure mode — submodule update fails

If `git submodule update --remote` fails (network, conflict, auth):

1. The session continues with the existing local SHA (stale-but-functional).
2. Warning surfaces at session start (`session-start-pull.sh` writes to
   `~/.claude/sync-failure.log` and prints to stderr).
3. Investigate before authoring; running on stale canonical risks losing recent
   methodology updates.

### Persona attribution

- Krystal: Clauda or Claudette family persona (one-per-workstream pattern;
  see `_grand_repo/role-manifests/` and SSOT-migrated copies at
  `.claude/canonical/mm-claude-canonical/role-manifests/`).
- Cody: single persona "Claude & Cody" (`claude-and-cody.yaml`); broad scope;
  pronouns they/them. Cody opted out of multi-persona overhead per decision

### ASAE-Gate enforcement

Every commit goes through `.githooks/commit-msg` (or whatever hook this repo
has installed). Threshold derives from this repo's `.asae-policy`:
- `audit_threshold: strict-5` → 5 passes + 2 raters + both CONFIRMED (canonical SSOT repos)
- `going-public: true` → strict-3 + 1 rater (default for going-public repos)
- `going-public: false` → standard-2 (default for stable-private repos)

See `.claude/canonical/mm-claude-canonical/references/ASAE_Gate_Quickstart_*.md`
when Spec Genius authors it (Batch 3 Lock A1) for the full quickstart.

# Orchestra Melody & Harmony

**Owner:** Krystal Martinez / Stahl Systems
**Type:** Public web application (SvelteKit, Vercel)
**Purpose:** Free web app that recommends AI model ensembles by task. Lead magnet for Orchestra Production.

## Product Definition

Users describe what they're trying to do with AI, and the app recommends:

- **Melody** — Primary model best suited to the overall task
- **Harmony** — Supporting models by subtask with reasoning
- **Cost estimates** at 4 scales: per 10, per 100, per 1,000, per 10,000 runs

Data refreshes daily from OpenRouter API + HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** SvelteKit + Svelte 5
- **Hosting:** Vercel (free tier)
- **Benchmark data:** Turso (edge SQLite)
- **Data refresh:** Vercel Cron (daily)
- **Recommendation engine:** Rule-based scoring (no LLM calls — deterministic, fast, free)
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **Testing:** Vitest + Playwright
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (lint > type-check > unit tests > build > integration tests > SAST Semgrep > npm audit > Gitleaks > preview deploy > E2E > Lighthouse CI > production deploy)
- **Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics + Sentry

## Critical Constraints

- **No auth in MVP** — Free tier only, no user accounts, no saved configs
- **No floating point for costs** — Use integer cents always
- **Rate limiting on all API routes** — Per-IP limiting (free tier abuse prevention)
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** — Built in at every UI stage, zero violations
- **Lighthouse targets:** ≥95 Performance, ≥95 Accessibility, ≥95 SEO, ≥95 Best Practices
- **Coverage targets:** TARGET 100% line/branch, MIN GATE 80% line/70% branch
- **Enterprise standards:** OWASP Web Top 10, CWE Top 25, CERT secure coding

## File Naming

Standard Stahl Systems pattern: `[PREFIX_][Description]_YYYY-MM-DD_vXX_[suffix].[ext]`

No PREFIX for this repo's internal files.
